# chip-huyen-ml-interview-book-solutions

I came across Chip Huyen's excellent book on preparing for the machine learning interview process, along with over 300 technical questions without solutions. This repo contains a Python script I wrote to extract all these questions and used GPT to generate detailed explanations and sample solutions.

## Result:

You will find the solution pdf file in this repository, which I will probably refine over time and update here.

## Contributions

If you would like to contribute to further refine the answer, you can DM on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyawhtetwin/). Thank you!

Feel free to share this with anyone who might benefit from it.

And a huge thank you to Chip Huyen for curating these insightful questions. [Check out the original book here](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/).
