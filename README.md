# chip-huyen-ml-interview-book-solutions

I came across Chip Huyen's excellent book offering guidance on preparing for the machine learning interview process, along with over 300 technical questions without solutions. This repo contains a Python script I wrote to extract all these questions and used GPT to generate detailed explanations and sample solutions.

# Result:

I am sharing the solutions pdf file in this repository, which I will probably refine over time and update here.
